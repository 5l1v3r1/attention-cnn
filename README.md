# cifar
MLO internal cifar 10 / 100 default implementation / reference implementation. single machine, variable batch sizes, allowing maybe gradient compression. need to have clear documentation to make it easy to use, and so that we don't loose time with looking for hyperparameters. we can later keep it in sync with mlbench too, but self-contained is even better
